QUESTIONS:

I am trying to run the tutorial scripts from a computer cluster. I am having
issues trying to use jupyter/ipython notebooks. Is it possible to run jupyter
from a cluster (possibly in conjunction with Xming or XQuartz) or is this a 
complete compatibility issue? Does your lab implement a similar strategy, or
are the tutorial-type scripts run on a local machine?

Thanks,
Jonathan

Tutorials - Usage:
==================

We provide tutorials that walk through the process of sector
identification for three protein families: the Ras-like small G-proteins,
the metabolic enzyme Dihydrofolate Reductase (DHFR), and the
antibiotic resistance enzyme Beta-lactamase. 

To run the SCA calculations for all three examples, you can execute the
following shell script:

>>> ./runAllNBCalcs.sh

For each example, this will generate the following outputs in the
Outputs/ directory:

  1.  A pickle database (\*.db file) that contains the results of the
      calculations (these are then read in and analyzed in the ipython
      notebooks - \*.ipynb)
  2.  A \*.log file that provides some information about the analysis 
  3.  A processed alignment (\*.fasta file) resulting from the
      scaProcessMSA script. 

Following this step, you can begin the tutorial as
an interactive ipython notebook from the command line as follows:

 >>> ipython notebook SCA_G.ipynb  

This should open the notebook in a browser window, where you can run
the code, and examine the SCA results.
